# StandaloneR2Squirrel

This project is to run the R2Squirrel script engine of the game Titanfall 2. Currently the compiler and the startup of the server vm work. 

To get this running copy the server.dll and the vstdlib.dll of the game into the directory of the executable.
For script files create a "base" and a "mods" directory in the same directory as the executable.
Extract the scripts from the game into the base directory they are in "mp_common","frontend" and since the standalone runs on the map rise "mp_rise" is also needed
Northstar mods and any other mods that may be used should be copyed to the mods folder
