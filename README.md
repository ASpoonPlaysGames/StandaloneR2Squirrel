# StandaloneR2Squirrel

This project is to run the R2Squirrel script engine of the game Titanfall 2. Currently the compiler and the startup of the server vm work. 



Usage guide:
1. Copy the server.dll and the vstdlib.dll of the game into the directory of the executable.

2. For script files create a "base" and a "mods" directory in the same directory as the executable.

3. Extract the scripts from the game into the base directory they are in "mp_common" and "frontend". Since the standalone runs on the map rise "mp_rise" is also needed

4. Northstar mods and any other mods that may be used should be copyed to the mods folder
